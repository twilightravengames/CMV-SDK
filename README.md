# CMV-SDK
An open source software developer kit with the necessary libraries and API to implement, post to, and request from, a Contiguous Meta-Verse remote service

CMV is inspired by the idea that a complete metaverse to replace the modern day Internet would allow people to don
avatars that would allow them to be seen past their gender, disability, etc. and be accepted by everybody
